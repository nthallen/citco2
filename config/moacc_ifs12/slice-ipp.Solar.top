: slice-ipp.Solar.top: The first two parameters are commented out
: here for inclusion by /home/citco2/bin/anal/exam.ksh

: Parameter #1 gives the directory path to the IFS125HR slice files.
: A trailing path separator is required.

: /home/citco2/raw/flight/

: Parameter #2 gives the directory path for the spectral files.
: A trailing path separator is required.

: /home/citco2/spectra/

: Parameters #3 and #4 control the saving of de-sliced interferograms
: and give the directory path for the interferogram files, respectively.
: Values for parameter #3 are:
:   0 = don't save de-sliced interferograms
:   1 = save raw de-sliced interferograms
:   2 = save de-sliced interferograms after de-glitching.
: A trailing path separator is required for parameter #4.

: Parameter #5 specifies the range of channels to be processed.
: For example, the current IFS125HR supports the following combinations:
:   1 2 = InGaAs and InSb
:   1 1 = InGaAs only
:   2 2 = Si only  /  InSb only

1 2

: Parameter #6 points to a file containing the frequency limits of
: spectral windows to be saved in the output files.

./flimit.ipp

: Parameter #7 gives a pattern for the CIT file-naming convention.
: Most characters will be transcribed unchanged.  A sequence of Y's
: will be replaced by the year using the same number of characters as
: the number of Y's.  The sequence of M's and D's will be similarly
: replaced by the month and day, respectively.  The letter S gives the
: location of the light source indicator, and the letter C specifies
: the location of the channel indicator.  The run number will take the
: space occupied by the sequence of R's.

cbYYYYMMDDShffaC.RRR   : Cambridge Bay IFS125 #12 when sapphire HCl cell is in place

: Parameter #8 lists the possible values for the light source indicator S.
: The slice file header is used to select one of these for the external
: port (solar scans), the internal source (lamp runs), or the all off
: case (noise runs).

sln

: Parameters #9 and #10 list the possible values for the channel
: indicator C.  Parameter #9 applies to interferogram files, whereas
: parameter #10 is for the spectrum files.  In these strings, there is
: one character per data channel.

AC

: Parameter #11 selects the format of the output files:
:   0 = no output
:   1 = ASCII file
:   2 = straight binary file without header, little-endian
:   3 = OPUS format

3

: Parameters #12 and #13 apply only in the case of ASCII output files.
: Parameter #12 is the field separator used between X and Y values:
: it must be guarded by double quotes to allow the space character to
: be used as field separator.
: Parameter #13 gives the number of min-max pairs in the output. Min-max
: output is used for plotting: for example, at 1200 DPI, 10000 points
: should be enough for a 8"-wide plot.  Setting this parameter to zero
: disables the min-max feature and each data sample results in a single
: output point.

10000

: Parameter #14 controls the data quality check based on the suntracker
: total intensity.  The first number is the maximum standard deviation
: of the solar intensity scaled to the average value.  The second number
: is the minimum value of the average suntracker intensity.  Setting a
: threshold to zero eliminates that particular check.

0.05 20.0

: Parameter #15 checks the igram data validity based on the extreme values
: MNY and MXY reported in the OPUS header.  For an igram to be valid, and
: therefore processed, both of the following must be true:
:   MNY > MN_thresh
:   MXY < MX_thresh
: There must be two entries (MN_thresh, MX_thresh) per data channel.
: For all-positive DC scans, MX_thresh detects saturation,
:                            MN_thresh detects dark scans.
: For all-negative DC scans, MN_thresh detects saturation,
:                            MX_thresh detects dark scans.
: For AC scans both limits can be used to detect saturation, but dark scans
: cannot be rejected.  With AC scans, no one knows which way is up anyway.

: Parameter #16 controls the data quality check based on the minimum
: value of the cross-correlation between runs.  There must be one entry
: per data channel.
: Setting a threshold to zero eliminates that particular check.
: THIS CHECK IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, BUT THE PARAMETER MUST BE PRESENT.

0.8 0.8

: Parameter #17 sets the maximum number of scans analyzed in a single
: execution of the program.  The only use of this feature is to limit
: the execution time for the diagnostic checks performed during the
: night.
: Setting the count to zero eliminates this limit.

55

: Parameter #18 sets the maximum log-base-2 of the number of interferogram
: points used to set the spectral resolution.  A value greater than 22
: ensures that we use all points produced by the current IFS125HR.
: There must be one entry per data channel.

23 23

: Parameter #19 limits the amount of processing performed by the program.
: This is useful in checking the early stages of the processing.
: The following levels are currently supported:
:   0 = perform no processing, just parse the input file
:   1 = read all run parameters from the IFS125 slices
:   2 = as 1, plus read all information contained in the ".info" files
:   3 = as 2, plus read the interferogram data from the IFS125 slices
:   4 = as 3, plus compute the spectrum
: If file saving is turned on, level 3 saves the de-sliced interferogram,
: and level 4 also saves the resulting spectrum.

4

: Parameter #20 controls the verbosity of the program.
: Currently the following levels are defined:
:   1 = display program name and error messages
:   2 = adds display of warnings
:   3 = adds display of information messages
:   4 = adds display of debugging messages
:   5 = adds display of more debugging messages

3

: The last parameter points to the starting slice for each run.
: Since the real-time acquisition system saves the slice files
: in separate directories for each day, we need to know the
: date (year, month, day) and the save set number, in addition
: to the number of the first slice of each run.
: An IFS125 "run" contains a number of scans (parameter NSS)
: which will be separated out by slice-ipp.
: The program can handle several runs in one execution by simply
: giving as many starting slice numbers as needed.
: One can comment out old runs by placing a ':' in front of them.
: Below is an example entry:
