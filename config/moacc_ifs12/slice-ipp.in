: This input file is used to trigger a special mode of slice-ipp
: in which it generates the 'resistors.h' header file used in
: the compilation of the real-time recording system.
:
: The 'resistors.h' file holds the list of resistor values that 
: are inside the two detector pre-amplifiers and set the conversion
: factors of the transimpedance input stage.
:
: The keyword "Resistors" is used to indicate this special mode.
: The numerical value after the keyword indicates which revision
: on the resistor values we are requesting.  This revision number
: starts at 1.
